Relations
=========

Functions
---------

Every function is a relation, not all relations are functions.

A relation is a function if there is only one possible output for a given input.

i.e. Every element in the domain is matched to only one value in the range.

If f(x) == y and f(x) == z, then if f() is a function, then y == z.
