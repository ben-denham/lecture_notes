Uniqueness of software quality assurance
========================================

* Software is never guaranteed to work the way it is implied it will work.

Software complexity:
--------------------

* Software has more modes of operation, so it is more complex to test that an
  industrial product.
* Consider the number of if-statements, loops, code paths, settings,
  configurations, inputs, etc.

Software visibility:
--------------------

* Software is invisible
* You cannot see defects in products

Development & Production Process
--------------------------------

* Limited opportunities to detect bugs
* Can only find bugs when in the product development phase.

Characteristics of the SQA environment process
--------------------------------------------

* Being contracted
* Subjection to customer-supplier relationship
* Requirement for teamwork
* Need for cooperation and coordination with other development teams
* Need for interfaces with other software systems
* Need to continue carrying out a project while the team changes
* Need to continue maintaining the software system for years

What is Software Quality?
=========================

Software
  Computer programs, procedures, and possibly associated documentation and data
  petaining to the operation of a computer system.

People have different experiences using the same software.

Software errors
  An error is a piece of incorrect code written by a programmer. This is
  whether it is invalid code, or if the logic is incorrect. An error may be
  unencounterable, if it can never occur because of other code.

Software faults
  A fault is when an error is actually encounterable in the software, and is
  waiting for someone to trigger it.

Software fialures
  A failure is when a software fault is actually encountered by a user.

Causes of software errors
-------------------------

* Faulty requirements definition
* Client-developer communication failures
* Deliberate deviations from software requirements
* Logical design errors
* Coding errors
* Non-compliance with documentation and coding instructions
* Shortcomings of the testing process
* User interface and procedure errors
* Documentation errors

Software quality
  1. The degree to which a system, component, or process meets specified
     requirements.
  2. The degree to which a system, component, or process meets customer or user
     needs or expectations.

  Best definition:

  Conformance to explicitly stated functional and performance requirements,
  explicitly documented development standards, and implicit characteristics of
  all professionally developed software.

Software Quality Assurance
  1. A planned and systematic pattern of all actions necessary to provide
     adequate confidence that an item or product conforms to established
     technical requirements.
  2. A set of activities designed to evaluate the process by which the products
     are developed or manufactured. Contrast with: 

  Best definition

  A systematic, planned set of actions necessary to provide adequate
  confidence that the software development process, or the maintenance process,
  of a software system product conforms to established functional technical
  requirements as well as with the managerial requirements of keeping the
  schedule and operating within the budgetary confines.

Objectives of SQA:

1. Assuring an acceptable level of confidence that the software will conform to
   functional technical requirements.
2. Assuring an acceptable level of confidence that the software will conform to
   managerial scheduling and budgetary requirements.
3. Initiation and management of activities to improve and increase the
   efficiency of software maintenance and SQA activities.

Software Quality Factors
========================

McCall's software quality factors model:

3 kinds of factors

Product operation factors
-------------------------

* Correctness (functional requirements)
* Reliability (uptime requirements)
* Efficiency (performance requirements)
* Integrity (security requirements)
* Usability (ease of training and use requirements)

Product revision factors
------------------------

* Maintainability
* Flexibility (Can the software be applied to different situations, or handle
  changes in software, or in business environment)
* Testability (How easy is the software to test?)

Product transition factors
--------------------------

* Portability (Can it easily be altered to run on a different systems)
* Reusability (Can code modules be reused in other applications)
* Interoperability (Can it interact with other software systems)

Who defines software quality requirements
=========================================

* The client (Correctness, reliability, etc.)
* The developer (Maintainability, portability, etc.)
