Software Testing
################

The goal of software testing is to find errors, not to prove the software is
working correctly. If you are trying to find bugs, you will find more.

Levels of Testing
=================

1. Unit/Module Testing
2. Integration/Functional Testing
3. System Testing

Top-down testing requires stubbing of modules that are depended on that have
not yet been developed.

Bottom-up testing requires drivers that simulate the use of the module by a 
module that has not been developed yet that will depend the module.
