Concentrate on **effectiveness** and **efficiency** of testing.

When determining the required level of software quality, consider the severity
of losses to customers/clients and the software developer in the case of
software failure.

When determining which modules/integrations/functions to test, consider:

  * S/W Damage level
  * Risks - probability of failure (Was the development team inexperienced?)
