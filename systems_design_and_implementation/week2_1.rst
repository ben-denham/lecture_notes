Systems Design and Implementation - 24/02/2014
==============================================

Dealing with Change
-------------------

Driving forces for change
`````````````````````````

* Operating Environment

  * Changes in competition
  * New marketing opportunities (China)

* Technology

  * More efficient manufacturing processes
  * LP -> CD -> MP3

* Political

  * Deregulation (e.g. Telecom)

* Social

  * Changes in attitudes (E.g. ecology)

Five forces drive competition
`````````````````````````````

* The Industry (Jockeying for Position among Current Competitors)
* Threat of New Entrants
* Bargaining Power of Customers (Esp. when few customers)
* Threat of Substitute Products or Services
* Bargaining Power of Suppliers (Esp. when few suppliers)

Non-technical issues to consider when implementing new systems
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
* Training - work environment
* Communication - with people affected - Acceptance?
* Resources - money, time, people
* How (Phased/Direct/Parallel)

Change Management
-----------------

The art of effectively and efficiently changing... anything?

BPR
  Business Process Re-engineering: large changes to the way the business works
  (sometimes causes redundancies).

**Change is difficult**: some people will welcome it, some people will resist
it.

When change is first imposed
````````````````````````````

  * Quality may suffer
  * Schedules may not be met
  * People may resist it

The challenge is to minimize time to acceptance.

People don't mind change, they just don't like being told to change.

Why are some people resistant to change?
````````````````````````````````````````

* Change threatens the status quo.

  * Perceived or real loss of control.
  * Change in job requirements.
  * Change in location.

* Lack of understanding as to why change is needed.

Reasons to Resist Change
````````````````````````

* Parochial self interest - People are more concerned with how they are
  affected, rather than how the organisation is affected.
* Misunderstanding
* Low tolerance to change
* Different assessments of the situtation - People don't agree with the reasons
  for the change.

Basic Change Model
``````````````````

'The Status Quo is held in place by the forces *for* and *against* change'
- Kurt Lewin

You must pay attention to 'gossip' (e.g. watercooler talk) when implementing a
system.

**E.g. Woolworths introducing barcode scanners**

*Forces for Change*

* Need to be competitive
* Advances in technology
* Leader's enthusiasm

*Forces Against Change*

* Fear of the unknown
* Unsure as to "Why?"
* New skills
* The need to change suppliers

Roles Associated with Change
````````````````````````````

* Sponsors / Champion

  * Instigator who recognises need for change
  * Persuades others of the value of change

* Agent

  * Activist - makes things happen
  * Translates the sponsor's vision
  * Often the members of the implementation team

* Targets

  * End users
  * People whose jobs will be altered

* Advocates

  * Members of IT department
  * End users not impacted by the change

Impact of Change
````````````````

Varies, but is based on:

* Magnitude of change
* Person's role - Targets impacted the most

SARAH Change Management Model
`````````````````````````````

Series of stages:

* Shock
* Anger
* Resistance
* Acceptance
* Hope

Must recognise:

* Some people skip stages
* Speed of progression through stages varies
* Relapses occur (going back to a previous stage)
* Not everyone reaches hope
* Survivor guilt - (e.g. people around you being laid off)

Change Management Continuum Model
`````````````````````````````````

Describes key activities needed to build commitment for change

3 major phases:

* Inform
* Educate
* Commit
