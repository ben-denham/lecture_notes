Systems Design and Implementation - 03/03/2014
==============================================

GUI's can make things simple, or very complex.

A stakeholder has a **vested interest** in the system.

Stakeholders do not necessarily interact with the system, e.g. managers, investors.

Persona
  An imaginary user who represents a collection of users.

Personas for wedding cake system users:

* Caterer

  * 30-40
  * Busy (time is of the essence; may not come in store at all)
  * Bulk orders.
  * Regular customer (Registration) Repeat past orders.
  * Phone contact (To organise specifics about an order; on the move)
  * Average time in advance
  * Non-picky (probably stock standard cakes, fast process)
  * May want a special cake along with the bulk lot of cakes (Not as picky as bridezilla
    though).
  * Pick up the cakes, or have them delivered (depending on caterer, very specific time)
  * Low tech skills, if ordering online with account, may use a tablet or desktop/laptop.
  * May want a special cake along with the bulk lot of cakes (Not as picky as bridezilla
