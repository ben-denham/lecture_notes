Components of Successful Change
-------------------------------

* Purpose - Communicate **why** the change must occur.
* Picture - Communicate **what** the end result will be.
* Plan - Knowing **how** to get to the end result.
* Part - Everyone needs to know what is expected of them.
* Commitment - Every stakeholder must be fully committed to making the change
  happen.

  * Methods - Effective tools and procedures.
  * Measurement - Measure the progress against the schedule.

Communication - The Critical Element
------------------------------------

Effective communication eases change and reduces resistance.

Effective communication is:

* Clear - no ambiguity, KISS
* Consistent - deliver the same message
* Targeted - designed for the audience
* Ongoing - remind stakeholders frequently

Rumour Mill
```````````

* Informal communication
* Frequently inaccurate
* Is expensive and hard to combat

Project teams should monitor the "Rumour Mill" for gossip, so that they know
what people are really thinking and what misinformation is out there. **Rumour
control sessions** can be used to find out what the current rumours about the
project are, and to dispel them and provide answers.

Formal Communication

Push
  Deleivered to audience without any action on their part. E.g. Meetings, memos,
  newsletters, posters.

Pull
  Audience required to do something to obtain the information. E.g. web pages.
