Systems Design and Implementation - 19/02/2014
==============================================

Many projects fail in one way or another.

Ways a project fails
--------------------

  * Over budget
  * Behind schedule
  * Not delivering functionality

Reason for failure
------------------

  * Rigid requirements.
  * Requirments omitted.
  * Goal seen as creation of Information System, but it should be the
    successful implementation of an Information System.
  * Assumed that once technical issues are resolved, acceptance and use are
    only a matter of time.

Implementation Factors
----------------------

  * Is the system being operated at **full** capacity, thus affecting and
    improving the performance of the **maximum** number of users?

Implementation is a **complex, multifaceted problem**.

Those in charge must have technical mastery and an understanding of
organisational and behavioural dynamics.

Implementation Success Model
----------------------------

* **Technical validity** - Does the technology work?
* **Organisational validity** - Will the new system be accepted and used by its
  intended clients.
* **Organisational Effectiveness** - What's the effect of the system on the
  organisation.

Another Implementation Success Model
------------------------------------

* System Traits

  1) System Quality
  2) Information Quality

* Characteristics of Data Use

  1) Use
  2) User Satisfaction

* Impact Assessment

  1) Individual Impact
  2) Organisational Impact

Remember
--------

* An information system is only as good as it is used
* Successful implementation may require system and client modification.
* When assessing success, give the system time to be incorporated into the
  client's operations.

Critical Success Factors
  Factors that play a significant role in determining the likelihood of
  implementation success or failure.

CSF - A Ten Factor Model
------------------------

1. **Project Mission** - clearly defined goals and general directions.
2. **Top Management Support** - Needed for resources and authority/power.
3. **Schedule/Plans** - Detailed specification (that may change).
4. **Client Consultation** - Communicate with all parties who will be impacted.
   The more you communicate with stakeholders, the more they will support the
   project.
5. **Personnel** - Recruitement and training of necessary personnel.
6. **Technical Tasks** - Availability of required technology and expertise.
7. **Client Acceptance** - Sell the final product to intended end users.
8. **Monitoring and Feedback** - Timely provision of comprehensive control
   information at each stage.
9. **Communication** - Provision of an appropriate network and necessary data to
   all key actors in the implementation process.
   Between the: *Implementation team*, *Top Management*, and *System Clients*.
10. **Troubleshooting** - Ability to handle unexpected crises and plan
    deviations.

Types of CSFs
-------------

* Strategic and Tactical
* Organisational and Technological

ERP
  Enterprise Resource Planning.

What Should You Do?
-------------------

* Keep the mission in the forefront
* Consult with your clients early
* Stay well connected to clients
* Make sure you haave adequate technology to succeed
* Set up and maintain a scheduling and control system
* Put the right people on the project team
* Make sure top management gets behind the system
* Continually ask the "What If" questions
* Improve the quality of the Analysis phase

  * Devil's advocate
  * Other organisations
  * Feature mapping - looking at different applications, and comparing the
    features in each
