To estimate project time:

* Break down tasks at an appropriate level (granularity) (3-7 days a task).
* Don't use a single method, use some of the following, and average the time:

  * top down
  * bottom up
  * PERT (best, expected, worst)

* Consider mathematical model (Function point analysis, etc.)
* Don't give a fixed price, give an estimated time+price range.
* Revisit price at every stage.
