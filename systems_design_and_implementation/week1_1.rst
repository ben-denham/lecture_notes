System's Design and Implementation - 17/02/2014

What is Systems Implementation
------------------------------

Systems Implementation is the **transitional phase** that takes an application
from the **development** environment into the **production** environment.

A Systems Implementation is the process of taking a **developed and tested
application** through to the stage where it can function in a **reliable**
fashion in the **user environment** providing the **agreed functionality**.

Components:
-----------

* Implementation Plan
* Procurement
* Site Preparation
* Data Conversion
  * Data Prepration and Capture
  * Controls
  * Security
* Documentation
  * If it moves, document it.
* Training
* Acceptance Testing
* Review

Iron Triangle
-------------

3 sides: Resources, Work, Time

If one side changes in size, 1 or 2 of the others must change.

Principles of Success
---------------------

* Top Management Support
* User Involvement
* Planning
* Professionalism
* Quality Documentation
* Quality Training

We start with PLANNING

The 5 Ps:
  Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance

The 5WH:

5WH
  I keep six honest serving-men
  (They taught me all I knew);
  Their names are What and Why and When
  And How and Where and Who.

Why
```

* To solve a business problem (The cause, no the symptom)

What
````

* Just what are we implementing?
* Known application to implement
* Unknown application to implement

  * Selection process for application

    * SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timebound)
      Requirements
    * Identification of potential solutions
    * Evaluation via RFP

When
````

* "Go Live Date"
  * Is it feasible?
* Linked to How - The Roadmap

How
```

* In House or Outsourced?
* Direct (Big Bang) or Phased?

  * If Phased?

    * What will be included in each phase

      * By site
      * By functionality
      * Or a combination?

    * How will the phases be chosen

      * Initial site or functionality

* Parallel Runs?

  * Run old and new systems in parallel
  * May not be feasible (duplicated data entry)

* Communicate the roadmap

  * Inform all impacted by the project (No suprprises)

Where
`````
* Single or Multiple sites?
* International?

**Remember: KISS**
