Systems Design and Implementation - 24/03/2014
==============================================

Project Management
##################

A project has:

* Deadline
* Deliverable
* Limited resources

Generally, there are *development teams* (Build new systems) and
*operations teams* (Keep existing systems running).

Business structure in a "good organisation"
-------------------------------------------

*CEO* has *senior managers* for each *silo* (business division e.g. Finance)
that report to him. Someone may have a *problem* or *opportunity*, which they
report as a *business case* to their senior manager, which gets passed to the .

The *project office* reports to the CEO, and contains *programme managers* for
each main concern of the company (e.g. customer service, infrastructure, support
). The programme managers make *feasibility studies* for business cases.

The *project committee* evaluates feasibility studies to decide which projects
to pursue. They will then tell the programme manager to proceed.

Once a project is approved, the programme manager will get a project manager and
team to implement the project.

It's not always that good
-------------------------

A project manager may not have had all of this preparation done. They need to
eliminate the *fuzzy front end* as much as possible.

Fuzzy front end
  The period at the beginning of a project where people don't have a firm grasp
  of what needs to be done in the project.

Project Manager's tasks
-----------------------

* Establish requirements with client - project charter
* Plan
  
  * Schedule
  * Budget
  * Scope document

* Provision

  * Recruitment
  * Training
  * Allocate
  * Organise

* Monitor + Control

  * Monitor the schedule and budget
  * Contingency
  * Communication plan (reports for clients + management)

The Project Management Triangle (Iron Triangle)
-----------------------------------------------

3 sides:

* Time - How long the project has until the deadline.
* Resources - How much money/people
* Scope - What the project will achieve

You can let the client tell you 2 of these, not all 3.

But of course, the client will try to tell you all 3.

Problems specific to IT projects
--------------------------------

IT projects are very difficult, and

* Lack of visibility (can't see progress easily)
* Lots of clients with different requirements
* Team communication is difficult because there are
  many specialists who don't understand each other.
* Lack of technical knowledge from management + clients.

IT Project Workers are not very good (not a good track record)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Standish Group's **Chaos Report**

**Capability maturity model** - Evaluates the maturity of company's ability to
do projects effectively (
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cmmi/cmmi-maturity-levels.htm)

* **Initial** (Process unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive)
* **Managed** (Process characterized for *projects* and is often reactive)
* **Defined** (Process characterized for the *organization* and is proactive)
* **Quantitatively Managed** (Process measured and controlled)
* **Optimizing** (Focus on continuous process improvement)

Most companies are at level 2, some at level 3, a few at level 4, and very few
at level 5 (only companies like NASA).
