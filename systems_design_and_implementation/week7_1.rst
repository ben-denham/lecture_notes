Managing People
===============

Types of Power for project managers
-----------------------------------

Legitimate power
  Officially given by the company; your authority.

Connection power
  Who you know; drop the names of the people you are connected to.

Coercive power
  Threatening punishment.

Reward power
  Opposite of coercive power; do a favour in exchange for work.

Expert power
  You know more about particular subject.

Information power
  You control communications: you communicate with client, users, etc. Members
  must go through you for information.

Referent power
  Based on personal attractiveness/charisma

*The project manager needs to hold as many of the sources of power as possible.*

Leadership styles
-----------------

Decision-making: Directive vs. permissive
Implementation: Autocrat vs. democrat

Plotted on continuous 2-dimensional axes.

Directive
  Make decisions yourself, and tell others what to do.

Permissive
  Yield decisions to team members.

Autocrat
  Tell who is doing what.

Democrat
  Let team members decide what they each want to do.

*Different styles suite different managers, members, and project situations.*

Theory X Managers
  Autocratic, controllin. Work is bad, and people have to be made to do it.

Theory Y Managers
  Democratic, trusting. Work is good, and people will do it willingly.


Three major concerns for project managers managing people:

* Staff selection

  Getting the right mix of *skills/experience* and *personality* ().

  *Skills/Experience*

  An experienced developer can be 28 times more productive than a beginner.

  *Personality*

  You need a mix of personalities that are suited to different team roles (
  Margerison-McCann).

  Myers-Briggs:
  
  * Introvert vs. Extrovert (Energy comes from being by yourself or with others)
  * Intuitive vs. Sensory (Solving problems - Intuitive: Lightbulb moment, then 
    leaps to the end; Sensory: Follows a set process)
  * Thinking vs. Feeling (Make decision with brain or heart)
  * Judgemental vs. Perceptive (Judgemental person wants a conclusion;
    Perceptive person wants to understand)

* Staff development

  * Some people prefer to work alone, some in a group
  * Oldham-Hackman Job Charactersitics Model

    * Skill variety: Staff wants to exercise a range of skills
    * Task identiy: Work identifiable as being done by staff member
    * Task significance: The influence the work will have on others
    * Autonomy: Staff member can make own decisions
    * Feedback: Staff member wants feedback

* Staff motivation

  * Incentives: money, time off, recognition, new experiences, more
    responsibility, "belonging", autonomy
  * Maslow's hierarchy of needs (When one level is met, a higher level is
    needed)

    * Low - physical (pay, conditions)
    * Middle - social (belonging, recognition, respect)
    * High - self-actualization (learning, personal growth)

  * Herzberg

    * Hygiene or maintenance factors: lack of lower needs leads to
      dissatisfaction.
    * Motivators: Meeting higher needs leads to motivation

  * Expectancy theory of motivation

    * Expectancy: the belief that working harder will lead to a better
      performance.
    * Instrumentality: the belief that performance will be rewarded
    * Perceived value of the resulting reward

  * Improve motivation by

    * Setting specific goals
    * Providing feedback
    * Considering job design (job enlargement and enrichment)

  * A particular reward will have a different effect on different people
  * Productivity - People perform better when they are monitored, given
    feedback, and recognised.
  * Social loafing - Team members who don't work. Fix with:

    * Making individual's work identifiable
    * Consciously involving group members in project outcomes
    * Rewarding individuals

Conclusion

* People are not only motivated by money.
* Staff selection and identification of training needs should be done in a
  structured way where requirements are clearly defined.
* Thoughtful job design increases motivation
* Undue pressure on staff can only have short-term gains
* project objectives should include health and safety issues
