"Step Wise"

0. Select project
1. Identify project objectives

   * List of SMART objectives and statement of how they will be judged (who?
     when?, criteria?)  
   * List of stakeholders, their roles and interests
   * Communication plan

2. Identify project infrastructure

   * Statement of links to strategic plan

     * Strategic goals
     * Dependencies/Constraints

   * Statement of business standards and procedures

     * Development
     * Implementation
     * Reporting
     * Change Management
     * Quality/Acceptance

   * Project team organisation chart

3. Analyse project characteristics

   * List of project characteristics (non-functional)

     * Criticality 
     * Performance
     * Locality (centralised/distributed)
     * Reliability
     * Volumes/Number and types of users

   * List of major risks
   * Statement of methodology/life-cycle approach

Steps 1,2 and 3 are intended to confirm and clarify the findings of the
Feasibility Study, and flesh out the detail as much as possible. They aim to
bring the Project Manager up to speed, prior to the detailed project planning.
Steps 1 and 2 can be done in parallel, but Step 3 depends on the other two.

Steps 1-3 are **high-level** and performed by the **project manager**.

4. Identify products and activities
5. Estimate effort for activity
6. Identify activity risks
7. Allocate resources

   * Gantt Chart

     * Resourced schedule
     * Revised critical path
     * Predicted project finish date

   * Risk Plan
   * Resource allocation report
   * Cost report


8. Review/publicize plan

Steps 4 – 8 represent the **planning step**. The project plan covers the
analysis, design, development, implementation and review phases. Step 4 produces
an outline plan. Steps 5-7 add detail, and result in iterations of the plan
until the project manager is happy that it is workable. Step 8 completes the
planning process.

Steps 4 - 8 produce a **project plan**.

* Durations
* Dependencies
* Critical Path
* Earliest project finish date

9. Execute plan
10. Lowever level planning

Steps 9 & 10 are the monitoring and control steps, as the project plan is
carried out. The project manager compares actual progress against the plan as
the work is carried out, and makes changes as the need arises.

An important principle of project planning is that you can’t plan for everything
in detail right at the start. There’s too much you don’t know. So the common
approach is to plan the current phase in as much detail as possible, and just
make a "best guess" for each of the later phases. As each phase is completed,
the plan for the next phase is revisited, and planned in greater detail. You can
see this on the diagram as a loop. As the plan is executed, progress is reviewed
and the details of the plan are revised. Obviously, the more detail you can
predict, the more accurate your estimate of the time and cost becomes. An
important project management skill is being able to manage the client’s
expectations of time and cost throughout the life of the project.

Figuring out project tasks
--------------------------

When figuring out the steps in a project, work backwards from the end
deliverables and *management products*, and break it down into what tasks you
need to do for each deliverable, and break it down further into what each task
requires.

Management products
  Plans, statements, etc. for management.

Planning is not just done at the start of the project. We start with broad
estimates of time (e.g. this will take 9-18 months). As the project goes on, we
can more accurately estimate times.

General Project steps (Steve McConnell ~=RAD)
--------------------------------------------

* Project Initiation
* Requirements definition phase (Prototype)
* Overall design
* Build/Test (depends on SDLC)
* Implementation (Installation & changeover)
* Review

Two approaches to determining time:

* Bottom up - List tasks in each steps, estimate those times, and add them up.
* Top down - McConnell has looked at project statistics and estimates times to
  be about:

  * 5%  - Project Initiation
  * 15% - Requirements definition phase (Prototype)
  * 10% - Overall design
  * 55% - Build/Test (depends on SDLC)
  * 10% - Implementation (Installation & changeover)
  * 5%  - Review

The top-down approach can be good for double-checking the bottom-up approach.

Your tasks should be broken down so that they each take around the same amount
of time. Having a task **granularity** that matches the monitoring period will
help with accurately monitoring/tracking progress. Tasks will not *always* match
up to be exactly the same length, but try to decide on a range that makes sense
for monitoring purposes.
