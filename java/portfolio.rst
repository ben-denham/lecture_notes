Week 1 Configuration:
---------------------
* Created a directory in my H: drive to store java code
  (``H:\java_course\java_code``).
* Added myconfig.bat into java_code, with the following environment variable
  configuration lines:

  * ``set path="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_45\bin"``
    * Which adds the java executables to the system path.
  * ``set classpath=h:\java_course\java_code``
    * Which sets my java code directory to the directory where java classes
      should be created.

* To test:

  * Run: ``cmd``
  * Move to H:\ drive (by running ``h:``)
  * Move to java_code (by running ``cd java_course\java_code``)
  * Run ``javac``
    * Confirm it cannot be found
  * Run ``myconfigb.bat``
  * Run ``javac``
    * Confirm usage is displayed, because we didnâ€™t provide a java code file.

``javac`` compiles java source files (``.java``), and ``java`` runs java class
files (``.class``).

javac may encounter compilation errors, java runtime may encounter logic errors.

Java **keywords** are all **lowercase**.

**Standard**: All class names are upper camel case.`

No members should be outside a class; no code should be outside of methods.

UML
---

* Classes are rectangles with names on top; top division containing attributes,
  and bottom division containing behaviours.
* Attributes contain values or addresses (obj refs)
* Behaviours are methods containing code.

First program
-------------

::

   class Employee {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       Employee emp = new Employee();
       emp.print();
     }

     public void print() {
       System.out.println("Hello World!");
     }
   }

* Put the code in ``ben1.java``
* Run ``javac ben1.java`` to compile the class in the file.
* Then, ``Employee.class`` has been created, so we can run ``java Employee`` to
  run the class with the java runtime (which invokes the main() method)
* **Explanation**:

  * ``Employee`` class containing a main method
  * ``main()`` must be:

    * **public** so it can be invoked from outside the class
    * **static** so that it does not need to be called on an instance
    * **void** because it returns nothing
    * and it must accept an array of strings (``String[] args``), which are the
      command line arguments.

  * We then use the System.out.println() method to print text to the console.
  * Making syntax errors will cause ``javac`` to complain (e.g. remove
    semi-colon)
  * Trying to call a non-static member from a static member will cause a
    compilation error, because the static member is not associated with an
    instance to call the non-static member on.
  * ``Employee emp = new Employee()`` explained

    * Declare a new variable in the stack (``emp``) to store a reference (memory
      address) to an Employee object.
    * Create a new ``Employee`` object in the heap, passing nothing to the
      constructor.
    * Assign (with =) the memory address of the new Employee to the emp
      variable.
    * The variable ``emp`` can now be used to reference the ``Employee`` object.
