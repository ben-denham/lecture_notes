Principles of Law

* Separation of powers
* Equality under the law
* Innocent until proven guilty

Separation of powers:
  The judiciary who implements laws is separate from the government who makes
  laws.

*Acts of Parliament* make up the *Statutes*.

Law
  A body of enforceable rules designed to control and guide human conduct.

Law reflects society's ethical beliefs.

Law is supposed to be objective. Justice is subjective.

In *criminal law* prosecutions are made by government departments (e.g.
Internal Affairs).

Laws are based on statutes, or judges' previous decisions.

*Private law* - between people/organisations.

*Public law* - between citizens and state.


*Criminal law* - Can be public or private law. Found in statutes.

*Civil law* - Purely private law.
