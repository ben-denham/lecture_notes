Professional Practice - 25/02/2014
==================================

When society influences technology, there may be good and bad effects of the technology on
society.

Something being ethically right is not the same as something being legally right.

Ethical judgement
  Deciding whether the influence society is having on the technology is a good or bad
  influence. Is the change made to technology right or wrong?

Wrong to sell a product that doesn't do what you claim it will do (known bugs/false 
advertising). Unknown bugs are slightly different, because it's not false advertising.

Anti-example: Open source

* List of known bugs
* Disclaimer is completely acceptable
* People can fix it themselves
* Not paid for, no expectations
* Note, could still be monetized

Emperical statement
  Descriptive statement; state what people do.

Normative statement
  Make a judgement; state what people should do.

Kantianism
----------

We should:

* Treat everyone with respect
* Treat people with humanity, not as means to your selfish ends. The means matter, not the
  ends.
* Act only in ways that would be acceptable if everyone acted that way
  (**universalisability**)

Ethics is about thinking rationally.

Utilitarianism
--------------

What makes actions right or wrong depends totally on the consequences.

We should aim to produce the greatest good for the most people.

We should aim to minimise harm.

It's the ends that matter, not the means.

Ethics is about trying to create happiness.

Homework
--------

1. Kant meant that all moral decisions should be based on universal moral laws.
   A universal moral law is one that applies to all rational beings, at all
   points in time (past, present, and future), and when applied universally in
   this way, does not logically contradict itself (E.g. if everyone could
   break promises, then there would be no point in anyone making a promise).
2. When 3 men are starving on a boat, and one is sick, if the other two men
   kill and eat the 3rd man, then he is being used as a means to the end of
   their own survival.
3. Act Utilitarianism does not evaluate the morality of the means to achieve a
   certain end, only the net happiness that is achieved by the end.
4. Kantianism determines whether a certain action is moral based on whether
   there is "good will" behind it; Utilitarianism determines whether a certain
   action is moral based on whether the action results in a net increase in
   "happiness".
