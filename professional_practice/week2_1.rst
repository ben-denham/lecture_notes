Professional Practice - 25/02/2014
==================================

When society influences technology, there may be good and bad effects of the technology on
society.

Something being ethically right is not the same as something being legally right.

Ethical judgement
  Deciding whether the influence society is having on the technology is a good or bad
  influence. Is the change made to technology right or wrong?

Wrong to sell a product that doesn't do what you claim it will do (known bugs/false 
advertising). Unknown bugs are slightly different, because it's not false advertising.

Anti-example: Open source

* List of known bugs
* Disclaimer is completely acceptable
* People can fix it themselves
* Not paid for, no expectations
* Note, could still be monetized

Emperical statement
  Descriptive statement; state what people do.

Normative statement
  Make a judgement; state what people should do.

Kantianism
----------

We should:

* Treat everyone with respect
* Treat people with humanity, not as means to your selfish ends. The means matter, not the
  ends.
* Act only in ways that would be acceptable if everyone acted that way
  (**universalisability**)

Ethics is about thinking rationally.

Utilitarianism
--------------

What makes actions right or wrong depends totally on the consequences.

We should aim to produce the greatest good for the most people.

We should aim to minimise harm.

It's the ends that matter, not the means.

Ethics is about trying to create happiness.
