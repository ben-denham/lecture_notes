1. Industrialized countries: UK, Holland, U.S., Canada, Australia, Italy. People
   offer to export waste overseas. Lack of money to recycle properly.
2. Food is exposed to toxic smoke from electronic waste. Fumes cause cancer.
3. Lead, Arsenic, Barium, Lithium, Mercury, Americium (radioactive). Hazardous
   in compounds used in electronic equipment.

   * Arsenic may disrupt cell communication and interfere with the triggers that
     cause cells to grow, possibly contributing to cardiovascular disease,
     cancer and diabetes if someone is exposed in chronic, low doses.
   * Cadmium affects your body's ability to metabolize calcium, leading to bone
     pain and severely weakened, fragile bones.
   * Chromium can cause skin irritation and rashes and is potentially
     carcinogenic.
   * Copper can irritate the throat and lungs and affect the liver, kidneys and
     other body systems.
   * Lead poisoning can cause a whole slew of health problems including the
     impairment of cognitive and verbal activity. Eventually, lead exposure can
     cause paralysis, coma and death.
   * Nickel is carcinogenic in large doses.

The Ministry defines a sustainable industry as an industry that:

* anticipates economic, environmental and social trends to minimise risk and
  takes opportunities to improve comparative advantage
* looks for new ways of doing business that improve economic, environmental and
  social performance
* looks for the business opportunities in using natural resources efficiently
* understands that today's competitive factors may not be tomorrow's
* understands impacts across business and product life cycles
* operates beyond traditional market and compliance boundaries
* works with its stakeholders effectively.

Figure 2: Sustainability requires considering social, environmental, and
enconomic factors.
