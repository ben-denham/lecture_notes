Law of Negligence
=================

* Area of tort law - civil wrong; not criminal law.
* A duty of care not to cause harm to one's neighbour.

Elements of Negligence
----------------------

* A duty of care is owed

  * Reasonably foreseeable injury
  * Does the community accept a duty of care in the case? Or would everyone get
    sued if there was a duty of care.

* The defendant acted in a way to breach that duty of care
* The damage suffered by the plaintiff is caused by the defendant's breach of
  duty (but-for test [but-for the breach of the duty, would the damage have
  occurred?])
* The damage is not too remote (legal causation)

Vicarious Libability
====================

* When one person takes the place of another so far as liability is concerned.

  * When one person is held to be liable for torts committed by a second person.

* Examples
  * Originally English master and servant.
  * Employer and employee.
  * Not usually contractors.
  * Parents and children?

Negligence and IT
=================

Who is a neighbour?

* Where information transferred from one computer to another.
* Visitors to an internet website.
* Liability of an internet service provider as an agent for the user.
* Recipient of an email containing a virus in the attachment.
* Purchasers of commercial software.
* Consumers of consultancy advice.

Key idea: Should society impose a duty?

Exclusion of Liability
======================

* An individual can exclude their liability in negligence by contracting out.
* Exclusion clauses are construed strictly - must exclude liability in a clear,
  precise and unambiguous.
* Incorporation by signature (part of signed contract).
* Incorporation by notice (not part of signed contract).

  * Notice must be given before the contract is made.
  * There must be reasonable notice.

* General words such as "any loss" or a reference to loss "howsoever caused" may
  not be sufficient.

Tips for aspiring IT professionals
==================================

* Take appropriate measures to ensure the product or service you are providing
  does not cause harm to the end-user.
* Incorporate exclusion clauses which are expressed clearly and precisely into
  contractural agreements.
* Consider
