==================================

Social Contract Theory
----------------------

"Morality consists in the set of rules, governing how people are to treat one
another, that rational people will agree to accept, for their mutual benefit, on
the condition that others follow those rules as well."

"Social contract theory holds that it is right for me to act according to a
moral rule if rational people would collectively accept it as binding because of
its benefits to the community."

Virtue Ethics
-------------

Disagrees with finding an answer "outside yourself" (e.g. consulting a theory).

In essence, virtue ethics states that *good* people will *know* what the right
thing to do is. That the answer to an ethical question exists inside oneself.
So the aim is for each person to be a *good* person.

Problem is defining a *good* person. In this case, defined by *virtues*. It is
claimed that you can have too much or too little of a particular virtue.

Virtues depend on the role (e.g. parent, business person, advertiser, etc.)

Professionalism
---------------

Some occupations are referred to as professions. Professions require formal
qualifications and prolonged education. They often have a **legal framework**
controlling the profession (legislation). It is *illegal* to practice outside
of the framework. Professions also more often require a **code of ethics**.
Also often has a **professional body** which manages the industry requirements.
The work of professions needs these restrictions because it is more crucial in
society.
