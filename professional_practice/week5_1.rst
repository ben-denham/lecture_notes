Touchless Interaction in surgery
--------------------------------

What applications could there be for teaching medical students?

Based on what you have learned, do you think it would be feasible to project
onto a patient?

Recommendations:

Must be incredibly careful to be accurate, usable, robust, so as to not cause
problems in the middle of a surgery.

Could artificial intelligence create an unemployment crisis?
------------------------------------------------------------

Could a shift in educational focus from *how* to do things to how to analyse,
interpret, and direct machines be at least a partial solution?

Interesting to note that humans are still distinctly better at some simple tasks,
such as pattern recognition. (for example, crowdsourcing for astronomy).

Cybercrime, cyberweapons, cyber wars: Is there too much of it in the air?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iranian plant in Stuxnet attack was running Windows.

Interesting note, hacker conferences are run where government officials seek to
hire the best hackers.

Rethinking passwords
--------------------

In light of the fact that Persona has been transitioned from full-time
development to community ownership, due to "less adoption than we were hoping
for by this point", do you think that a "single solution" approach is viable, or
is it too difficult to get all stakeholders to cooperate?

Do you think it is dangerous to have all sign ins going through a single service
(Persona)?

Recommendations:

Carefully consider your password policy. Don't just listen to rhetoric. Look at
alternatives to passwords. Two-factor authentication. Responsibility of IT
professional to implement best practice.

No limits to watching?
----------------------

Could a red light on the front of a recording set of glasses be useful in
helping make bystanders aware they are being recorded?

In regards to the concept of more data being more widely available, and the
conclusions that can be made from that data, do you have any thoughts on
privacy and ethics regarding genetic data (E.g. if an insurance company finds
you have a gene that makes you more susceptible to some condition, can they
discriminate against you?).

Recommendations:

If you're developing a device, think about society. Consider implementing a
feature to let the public know they are being recorded. Even if it doesn't
become law immediately, you have a responsibility as an IT professional.

Hacking cars
------------

What if we moved to a model of open-source software in cars? Could the model work?
Would exploits be more easily discovered and fixed?

Also, even scarier, people hacking your implants and other devices.

Why computer talents become computer hackers
--------------------------------------------

Do you think that the same environment in schools that leads to hackers (open
systems, no punishment, even encouragement) exists in New Zealand?

The closed nature of many mainstream devices (i.e. iPad, Windows 8)
could help reduce the number of young people attracted to hacking. Devices like
the Raspberry Pi are really encouraging more young people to get into
discovering computer science. Could be considered a two-edged sword.

Recommendations

As an industry, we must guide talented individuals toward productive use of
their skills (White hat) and take a hard line on black hat activities. Black hat
activities should be frowned upon by all IT professionals, as they are unethical
and break code of practice.

Computing technologies for reflective, creative care of people with dementia
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you think the concept of the talk reflection app could be applied to other
professions and tasks? E.g. An E.R. nurse coping with losing a patient.

In the case of digital life history management, who should own the rights to the
data? The patient? The relatives? The carers?

Recommendations:

Carefully consider who has rights to the information in digital life history
management. Make sure appropriate information is available to the appropriate
users. Make sure system has a positive focus.
