Noel Gane - Employment Relations
================================

Employment Relations
  * The *formal* and *informal* rules that regulate the employment relationship;
  * The relative *powers* of the parties to that employment relationship;
  * and how those powers are established and exercised;
  * and the processes by which the rules and the respective powers of the
    parties are modified and changed.

Formal rules:
  Employment contract, laws (minimum wage, holidays).

Informal rules
  Respect, honesty, handling of data, company culture, industry standards.

Short definition:
  Getting labour, using it, and getting rid of it.

Contexts of considering employment relations:

* Political - (Right wing: employers; Left wing: unions)
* Legal - (Laws need to be updated to meet new standards)
* Economic - (In hard times, people try to keep hold of jobs)
* Social - (Work is a normal social activity; U.N. resolution that there is a
  human right to work)
* Cultural - (What is expected in culture; e.g. working from home is now
  acceptable)
* Institutional - (Unions, Professional bodies, etc. Each have ideologies, and
  standards)

Perspectives of viewing employment relations:

* Individual (How am I affected)
* Group
* Department
* Organisation
* Industry
* National
* International - (If international standards aren't met, a country can't
    trade because they have an unfair advantage)

Employment relationship parties:

* Employees (and their representatives, (family, lawyer?))
* Employers (and their representatives, (directors, managers, HR))
* Government as:

  * Employer (Biggest employer in the country)
  * Regulator of industry
  * Interventionist (Changing things to suite, e.g. Hobbit law change)

Employer is generally the legal entity of the company, not the directors.
Certain exceptions, e.g. MIT staff employed by the CEO, so they are not employed
by the MIT council. 

Employment Relationship is a *psychological contract*, it .

Common law of contract
----------------------

* System of establishing relationships.
* "Commercial" vs "Psychological" contracts.

  * Psychological components relate to what is expected beyond what is legally
    enforceable. E.g. enthusiam.

* There is a move away from the "legal" obligations to "relationship"
  obligations (good faith).

Elements of a contract
----------------------

* Intention (to actually be an employee)
* Consent (You consent to enter into the contract)
* Capacity (Can't enter contract if you are insane, under a certain age, or
  don't have a work permit. Or, do you have the ability to do the work, or there
  is restraint of trade)
* Legality (Terms of contract must be legal)
* Agreement (There must be an official offer & official acceptance)
* Consideration (There must be benefits of equal value to both parties)

Labour is the only way to add value. Marxist?

Options for using labour:
-------------------------

* Employee

  * Any person employed to do work under a contract of service.
  * Includes homeworkers (working from home) or someone intending to do work.
  * Excludes volunteers who expect no reward and receive no reward (reward does
    not include reimbursement).
  * Excludes someone working in relation to a film production (see Hobbit).

  * Permanent Fulltime

    * Over 30 hours, no set end date

  * Permanent Parttime

    * Under 30 hours, no set end date

  * Fixed term

    * Start and end point pre-determined
    * If a job is fixed term, there must be a declared reason
    * No such thing as casual work, just many fixed terms
    * Used for seasonal or holiday work
    * Person hired to replace an employee on parental leave

  * Probationary

    * Employee employed to test if they can get up to standard needed
    * If employee is dismissed at the end, the company must show they did
      everything they could to train the employee
    * An employee can still dispute a decision
    * Rejection cannot be made on general reasons

  * 90 day trial

    * Only for new employees (who have never been employed by the company)
    * Must be included as part of the initial offer

* Contractor

  * Not related to the Employment Relations Act
  * Contract may be oral or in writing

There are tests that determine whether someone is an employee or contractor,
e.g. is the work controlled by the employer (employee), whether they act as if
they have their own business, like tax (contractors).

Employee = Contract of service; Contractor = Contract for service

Differences:

* Control of work (employee's work is controlled, contractor just has to do
  task)
* Integration (Is the person a part of the organisation? Office, phone list)
* Hours of work (Contractors are more flexible)
* Tools (Employers provide tools for employees, contractors provide tools)
* Equipment and materials (Employers own materials, not employees. Contractors
  own materials generally)
* Sick pay (Employees yes, contractors no and may )
* Holiday pay (Employees yes, contractors no)
* PAYE tax (Employees yes, contractors no)
* ACC (Employees yes, contractors no)
* Workplace insurance (Employees yes, contractors no)
* Method of payment
* Hiring and firing (Contractors cannot be fired)
* Contractors do not have not have to do the work personally
* Opportunity for profit or loss (Employees do not generally have risk, but a
  contractor takes the risk of underquoting)

Tests for these differences:
----------------------------

* Control Test
* Organisation (integration) Test
* Economic Reality (business) Test
* The Mixed or multiple Test

Courts decide what is employment, and what is a contract, regardless of what is
stated on the agreements.

Employment Agreement Ability

Performance objectives + rest on page - could have
Probably flexible location for programmer

Never pay supervisors overtime?
