Iwi make *claims* to tribunal. The Tribunal then decides if the claim is
relevant to the Treaty of Waitangi. The claim must be *comprehensive* and
*proved*. A successful claim will get a WAI number. Hearings are then held,
where selected members of the tribunal (incl. lawyers & experts) listen to
anyone who wants to give information. The commission then makes recommendations
to the crown, which they don't have to listen to. There can then be negotiation
between the crown and Iwi. This negotiation leads to settlements.
