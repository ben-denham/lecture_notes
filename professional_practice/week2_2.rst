==================================

We all face **ethical decisions**. Generally, we answer these questions with our
own **personal ethics**, but we can also use **ethical theories** (Kantianism, 
Utilitarianism, etc.) to help make decisions that we can formally back up.

Look at

Click Farm Scenario
-------------------

Kantianism
``````````

* People are being used (They are being deceived as to the organisations popularity.)
* Not universalisable: People will not be able to trust anyone if everyone is deceptive.
  And if no one trusts anyone, there is no point in lying.

Utilitarian
```````````

* Benefits: Company gets more visibility, employment
* Harms: Company could be found out.

Rights
------

Having a **right** means we **expect** others to

* Leave us alone (**negative right**)
* Provide something for us (**positive right**)

Justice
-------

Fairness, consideration, participation are all part of a democratic society.

We expect:

* Processes that are fair
* That wrongs will be corrected
* That there will be redress for historical and unexpected unfairness
* People to be treated equitably (not the same as equally)

Theory of Justice
  An inequality in society is acceptable only if:

  * Everyone in society has equal opportunity to obtain the advantage.
  * The inequality provides the most benefit to the least advantaged.
