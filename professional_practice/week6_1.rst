Seminar questions
=================

Computer Security and Modern Home
---------------------------------

What if we moved to a model of open-source software in home electronics? Could
the model work? Would exploits be more easily discovered and fixed?

Even implants with wireless communication functions can be hacked.

Why not Immortality
-------------------

Could there be a social problem with not everyone being able to afford
"immortality"? See: Elysium.

What about the possibility of making plants and animals immortal?

The web will not be safe
------------------------

I believe there is a suggestion of rebuilding web infrastructure to be encrypted
by default.
